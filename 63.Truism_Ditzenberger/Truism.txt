So the truism I chose was "EVERY ACHIEVEMENT REQUIRES A SACRIFICE". As a super basic example I surrounded my highschool diploma with
calendars. We sacrifice our own time for education but in the end, achieving graduation is well worth it.  

The sound I am using is a song called "Changes" by Black Sabbath. I felt that this song was fitting because when we dedicate our time to
hitting a goal or achievement we sometimes have to make changes to ourself or those around us to get to the destination we desire.
